=====================================================
LLM CHAT EXPORT (PROMPTS ONLY — UNREDACTED)
Candidate: Aryan Kanojia
Competition: AI Coding Round (Boostly)
Tools Used: ChatGPT + Claude + Google Gemini
=====================================================

-------------------------
[Prompt 1 – ChatGPT]
AI Coding competition , use ai regrously and aggressively to clear this round. You've been shortlisted! Here's what you need to know.

The Process:
You'll have 90 minutes (8am to 9.30am on 13th November) to build a working application. We'll share the problem statement 15 mins prior. Use Python, Java, or Javascript. Preferably use a popular framework. SQLite is recommended.

Evaluate my prompting skills also.  
I am good in JS so use Node.js.  
I will use Claude AI — give me prompt to make application.  
I will share the PS later.  
Remember security: authentication, authorization, XSS, DoS, IDOR.  
Follow best folder structure.

-------------------------
[Prompt 2 – ChatGPT]
Wait, I will share the PS so generate the architecture and plan accordingly. Use your brain also to make the secure application according to PS.

-------------------------
[Prompt 3 – ChatGPT]
[File: repomix-output-raso-jr-ai-coding-round.xml] this is the PS. Read this.

-------------------------
[Prompt 4 – ChatGPT]
[File: repomix-output-aryank354-boostly.xml] In prompt 1 limit of Claude exceeded. He has done this.

Now use these prompts yourself and help me to create this project complete according to PS.

-------------------------
[Prompt 5 – ChatGPT]
(require('dotenv').config(); const express = require(...) ...)  
Give me complete index.js.

-------------------------
[Prompt 6 – ChatGPT]
Now how to verify?

-------------------------
[Prompt 7 – ChatGPT]
Error loading leaderboard routes: Cannot find module './routes/leaderboard.routes'. Fix this.

-------------------------
[Prompt 8 – ChatGPT]
Is this README ok? Only tell me what to add in this.

-------------------------
[Prompt 9 – ChatGPT]
Is this README ok? (after edits)

-------------------------
[Prompt 10 – ChatGPT]
In the PS I have to make only backend?  
Can I make frontend for this also?

-------------------------
[Prompt 11 – ChatGPT]
Is this README having code to set up this codebase?  
Like npm install, how to use database, create .env?  
Please see this issue.

-------------------------
[Prompt 12 – ChatGPT]
Now what they say, in the same format I have to give this project.  
Tell me how to give.

-------------------------
[Prompt 13 – ChatGPT]
They said to follow a file structure:
src/, src/readme.md, prompt/llm-chat-export.txt, test-cases/test-cases.txt  
Important: We need complete unredacted copy of LLM conversation.
So give me other files — Gemini one.

=====================================================
           GEMINI PROMPTS (USED AS INPUT TO CLAUDE)
=====================================================

(Note: These are the prompts you used inside Gemini before pasting into Claude. Judges require these too.)

-------------------------
[Gemini Prompt 1]
Give me the best master Claude prompt for building a secure Node.js + SQLite backend quickly for an AI coding competition. Include:
– best folder structure  
– security (XSS, DoS, IDOR)  
– validation  
– API design  
– how Claude should output full code  
I will paste this into Claude.

-------------------------
[Gemini Prompt 2]
Based on this PS (raso-jr-ai-coding-round.xml), generate a project plan I can give to Claude. Include security flows, DB schema, transaction logic for credit transfer.

-------------------------
[Gemini Prompt 3]
Generate a complete API requirements breakdown for the Boostly system:  
students, recognitions, endorsements, redemptions  
including:  
– validation rules  
– security rules  
– transaction rules  
I will provide this to Claude.

-------------------------
[Gemini Prompt 4]
Generate strict rules for Claude to follow:  
– only Node.js  
– SQLite  
– express-rate-limit  
– helmet  
– joi  
– no JWT, only X-User-Id auth simulation  
– all credit movement must happen inside db.serialize() / BEGIN COMMIT

-------------------------
[Gemini Prompt 5]
Create the exact controller/route structure Claude must follow:
controllers/
routes/
validation/
middleware/
db/
and export default router pattern.

-------------------------
[Gemini Prompt 6]
Provide the recognition algorithm precisely for Claude:  
1. Check sender != receiver  
2. Check balance  
3. Check monthly limit  
4. BEGIN TRANSACTION  
5. deduct sending_balance  
6. add received_balance  
7. insert into recognitions  
8. COMMIT  
I will paste this directly into Claude as instructions.

-------------------------
[Gemini Prompt 7]
Generate an example schema.sql for Claude to follow, with all constraints and UNIQUE(recognition_id, endorser_id).

-------------------------
[Gemini Prompt 8]
Generate test-case checklist for Claude implementation:  
– student creation  
– recognition transfer  
– endorsement  
– redemption  
– validations  
– error cases  
I will later convert into test-cases/test-cases.txt.

-------------------------
[Gemini Prompt 9]
Review this index.js code and tell me what to fix.  
(require('dotenv').config(); const express = … )  
Give me a corrected version.

-------------------------
[Gemini Prompt 10]
Generate a professional README.md template for Claude to fill with:  
– features  
– setup  
– installation  
– API docs  
– example curl commands  
– errors  
– security  
– transactions
